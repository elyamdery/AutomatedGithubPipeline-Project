# **AutomatedPipeline Project**

---

### **What is this?**  
A self-learning project simulating how a developerâ€™s brain works: constantly pulling, refining, and pushing ideas. Automates pull-modify-push cycles in GitHub to mimic real-world workflows and explore automation concepts.

---

### **Why this?**  
- **Learn Automation**: Hands-on with pipelines and Git workflows.  
- **Showcase Skills**: Demonstrates automation expertise to employers.  
- **Symbolic**: Represents how developers keep iterating and improving.  

---

### **How it Works**  
1. **Schedule**: Runs every 30 minutes from 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM, 24/6 (Saturday off).  
2. **Automated Tasks**: Pull latest, modify content (e.g., timestamps), push changes.  
3. **Logging**: Tracks all actions (success/errors).  

---

### **Tools Used**  
- **Python**: For scripting.  
- **Git**: Pull/modify/push.  
- **Cron Jobs**: Task scheduler.  
- **Jenkins (Soon)**: Will integrate for advanced automation.  

---

### **Outcome**  
- A working pipeline for continuous GitHub activity.  
- Logs for transparency and troubleshooting.  
- Real-world automation experience to grow your skills.

### **Note**  
This is a self-learning project. The Jenkins integration will be added soon, and the updated version will be published.
